# 📸 Insta-Clone Web Page

## 📖 Project Overview

This is a single-page, front-end clone of the main Instagram feed interface, built for demonstration purposes.  
It replicates the **dark mode aesthetic**, layout, and core components of the popular social media platform — including the persistent navigation bar, the stories tray, and the post feed, with a dedicated suggestions sidebar for desktop views.
